BTBA October seminar: Large scale manufacture tech transfer and pharmaceutical operaion: day-to-day job and challenge
Speaker: Eric Peng, Senior Engineer II, Manufacturing Science, Biogen Idec 

Join us for a special seminar right before BTBA’s monthly meeting! Eric will share his experience in large scale manufacture in coordination with a cross-department team consisting of more than 10 functions and 100 engineers/scientists. Wondering how research results in the laboratory are turned into actual products? Curious about skills and expertise required in this process? You wouldn’t want to miss this talk.
